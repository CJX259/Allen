It also features live chat, which allows anchors and audience members to interact with each other, making it ideal for remote teaching, vocational training, corporate live streaming, live shopping, and other use cases.';\nconst zhContactUs = '接入及使用中有任何问题，可以加入【TUI组件使用交流 QQ 群】(群号：592465424）沟通交流。';\nconst enContactUs = 'If you have any questions when using the component, feel free to <a href=\"https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/contact-us\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.';\nexport default {\n  name: 'video-record',\n  data() {\n    return {\n      infoMessage: '',\n      contactUs: '',\n    };\n  },\n  watch: {\n    '$i18n.locale': {\n      immediate: true,\n      handler(val) {\n        if (val === 'zh') {\n          this.infoMessage = zhInfo;\n          this.contactUs = zhContactUs;\n        } else if (val === 'en') {\n          this.infoMessage = enInfo;\n          this.contactUs = enContactUs;\n        }\n      },\n    },\n  },\n};\n</script>\n\n<style lang=\"stylus\" scoped>\n  .info-container\n    width 100%\n    height 100%\n    color $grayFontColor\n    padding 20px 25px 25px\n    font-size 16px\n    text-align left\n    word-break break-all\n    p.contact-us\n      margin-top 20px\n</style>\n\n<i18n>\n{\n\t\"en\": {\n\t\t\"Coming soon\": \"Coming soon\"\n\t},\n\t\"zh\": {\n\t\t\"Coming soon\": \"\"\n\t}\n}\n</i18n>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./comp-info.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./comp-info.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./comp-info.vue?vue&type=template&id=5344fac2&scoped=true&lang=pug&\"\nimport script from \"./comp-info.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./comp-info.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./comp-info.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=5344fac2&lang=stylus&scoped=true&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  \"5344fac2\",\n  null\n  \n)\n\n/* custom blocks */\nimport block0 from \"./comp-info.vue?vue&type=custom&index=0&blockType=i18n\"\nif (typeof block0 === 'function') block0(component)\n\nexport default component.exports","<template lang=\"pug\">\ndiv.player-message-container(:class=\"$isMobile ?
